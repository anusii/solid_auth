## Acknowledgement

Parts of this package (under `lib/src/openid`) are derived from the
[openid_client](https://pub.dev/packages/openid_client) package, with
custom modifications to support the Solid OIDC authentication flow. We
would like to acknowledge and thank the authors of `openid_client` for
their valuable work, which made these adaptations possible.

## Usage

Fork the demo app in the `\example` directory into a local directory
and open the `pubspec.yaml` file. Check whether the latest version of
the package `solid_auth` is added under dependencies. Now run the
following to get the necessary packages.

```dart
flutter pub get
```
