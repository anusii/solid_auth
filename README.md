# Solid Auth

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/solid_auth.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/solid_auth)

A Flutter library for authenticating with [Solid pods](https://solidproject.org/) using OpenID Connect, implementing the [Solid-OIDC specification](https://solid.github.io/solid-oidc/).

This library provides a simple, reactive interface for Solid authentication that handles the complexity of OIDC flows, token management, WebID discovery, and DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession) tokens required by Solid servers.

Built on the robust foundation of [Bdaya-Dev/oidc](https://pub.dev/packages/oidc), this package focuses specifically on Solid pod authentication while leveraging excellent, well-maintained OpenID Connect functionality.

This package includes an embedded copy of the [dart_jsonwebtoken](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_jsonwebtoken) package with modifications for Solid-OIDC compatibility.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîê Complete Solid Authentication**: Full implementation of Solid-OIDC specification
- **üì± Cross-Platform**: Works on web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop (macOS)
- **üîÑ Reactive State Management**: Use `ValueListenable` to reactively update UI based on authentication status
- **üíæ Automatic Session Restoration**: Persists authentication across app restarts
- **üõ°Ô∏è DPoP Token Support**: Handles security tokens required by Solid servers
- **üåê WebID Discovery**: Automatically discovers identity providers from WebIDs
- **üîí Secure Token Storage**: Uses platform-appropriate secure storage mechanisms

<!-- ## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package. -->

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Add to pubspec.yaml

```sh
dart pub add solid_auth
```

### 2. Create Your Client Profile

Create a `client-profile.jsonld` file and host it on HTTPS:

üí° **Hosting Tip**: Don't have a server? You can easily host this file for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Just commit the file to your repository and enable static hosting.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/oidc-context.jsonld",
  "client_id": "https://myapp.com/client-profile.jsonld",
  "client_name": "My Solid App",
  "application_type": "native",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://myapp.com/auth/callback.html",
    "com.mycompany.myapp://redirect"
  ],
  "post_logout_redirect_uris": [
    "https://myapp.com/auth/callback.html",
    "com.mycompany.myapp://logout"
  ],
  "scope": "openid webid offline_access profile",
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

üö® **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The `client_id` field **must** be the exact URL where you host this document.

If you host this at `https://myapp.com/client-profile.jsonld`, then:
- The `client_id` field **must** be `"https://myapp.com/client-profile.jsonld"`
- The `oidcClientId` parameter **must** be `'https://myapp.com/client-profile.jsonld'`
- Both values **must** be identical

### 3. Initialize SolidAuth

```dart
import 'package:solid_auth/solid_auth.dart';

// Initialize SolidAuth with your client configuration
final solidAuth = SolidAuth(
  // This URL must exactly match the "client_id" field in your client-profile.jsonld
  oidcClientId: 'https://myapp.com/client-profile.jsonld',
  appUrlScheme: 'com.mycompany.myapp',
  frontendRedirectUrl: Uri.parse('https://myapp.com/auth/callback.html'),
);

// Initialize and check for existing session
await solidAuth.init();
```

### 4. Build Reactive UI

```dart
// Build reactive UI based on authentication state
ValueListenableBuilder<bool>(
  valueListenable: solidAuth.isAuthenticatedNotifier,
  builder: (context, isAuthenticated, child) {
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      return Text('Welcome, ${solidAuth.currentWebId}!');
    } else {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () => authenticate(),
        child: Text('Login with Solid'),
      );
    }
  },
);
```

### 5. Authenticate Users

```dart
// Authenticate with a WebID or identity provider
Future<void> authenticate() async {
  try {
    final result = await solidAuth.authenticate(
      'https://alice.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me'
    );
    print('Authenticated as: ${result.webId}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Authentication failed: $e');
  }
}
```

### 6. Make Authenticated API Requests

```dart
// Generate DPoP token and make authenticated request
Future<void> fetchPrivateData() async {
  // Generate DPoP token for the specific request
  final dpop = solidAuth.genDpopToken(
    'https://alice.solidcommunity.net/private/data.ttl',
    'GET'
  );

  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://alice.solidcommunity.net/private/data.ttl'),
    headers: {
      ...dpop.httpHeaders(), // Includes Authorization and DPoP headers
      'Accept': 'text/turtle',
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('Private data: ${response.body}');
  }
}
```

## üìö Comprehensive Examples

### Authentication with Additional Scopes

```dart
// Request additional scopes (must be declared in client-profile.jsonld)
final result = await solidAuth.authenticate(
  'https://alice.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me',
  scopes: ['profile', 'email'], // Additional to required: openid, webid, offline_access
);
```

### Authenticate with Identity Provider URL

```dart
// Authenticate directly with provider (skips WebID discovery)
final result = await solidAuth.authenticate(
  'https://solidcommunity.net'
);
```

### Session Management

```dart
// Check authentication status
if (solidAuth.isAuthenticated) {
  print('User: ${solidAuth.currentWebId}');
}

// Logout user
await solidAuth.logout();

// Clean up resources
await solidAuth.dispose();
```

## üîê Client Configuration Guide

### Required Scopes

Your `client-profile.jsonld` **must** include these mandatory scopes:
- `openid`: Required for OpenID Connect authentication  
- `webid`: Required for Solid WebID functionality
- `offline_access`: Required for token refresh capability

### Redirect URI Patterns

The library automatically constructs redirect URIs based on your platform:

**Web Platform:**
- `redirect_uris`: Your exact `frontendRedirectUrl`
- `post_logout_redirect_uris`: Your exact `frontendRedirectUrl`

**Mobile/Desktop Platforms:**  
- `redirect_uris`: `{appUrlScheme}://redirect`
- `post_logout_redirect_uris`: `{appUrlScheme}://logout`

## üîß Platform Setup

**üìö Important**: For complete platform-specific setup instructions (web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux), see the comprehensive [OIDC Getting Started Guide](https://bdaya-dev.github.io/oidc/oidc-getting-started/).

### Web Applications

Create a redirect handler HTML page at your `frontendRedirectUrl` location. **Use the official redirect.html from the [OIDC Getting Started Guide](https://bdaya-dev.github.io/oidc/oidc-getting-started/)** to ensure compatibility with the latest OIDC package version.

### Mobile & Desktop Applications

Each platform requires specific configuration for URL schemes and redirect handling.

See the [OIDC Getting Started Guide](https://bdaya-dev.github.io/oidc/oidc-getting-started/) for detailed, up-to-date instructions for each platform.

## üîí Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: All redirect URIs must use HTTPS in production
- **Client Registration**: All redirect URIs must be listed in your client profile document  
- **DPoP Tokens**: Generate fresh DPoP tokens for each API request - never reuse them
- **Token Storage**: The library uses secure platform storage for sensitive data
- **WebID Validation**: WebIDs are validated by fetching profile documents and verifying identity providers

## üåü What is Solid?

[Solid](https://solidproject.org/) is a web decentralization project that gives users control over their data by storing it in personal data pods. Users authenticate with identity providers and grant applications specific access to their data.

## Roadmap

### Offline-First Support
Currently, `solid_auth` requires network connectivity during initialization to:
- Discover identity providers from WebID profiles
- Fetch OIDC provider configurations
- Validate authentication sessions

**Future Goal**: Enable fully offline-first applications that can start and function without network connectivity, using cached authentication data and provider configurations.

This is essential for truly offline-capable Solid applications, but requires careful consideration of security trade-offs and cache management strategies.

### Windows/Linux Desktop Support
The OIDC library supports Windows and Linux via localhost loopback device with random ports. 
Configuring `localhost:*` in the client profile probably is not a good idea for security reasons and possibly
disallowed by many Solid pod implementations, so we need to find out if this really is a problem or if it 
does work after all, or if we find some way to make it work for those two platforms.
